    \\
    \\
    My interdisciplinary background in architecture provides a distinctive perspective on spatial reasoning and systematic design that directly translates to AI navigation systems and pathfinding algorithms. Combined with my passion for game development, this positions me to bring innovative solutions to Unreal Engine's AI framework.
    \\
    \\
    \textbf{Key Qualifications:}
    \\
    • Extensive \textbf{C++} programming experience with strong software engineering principles\\
    • Deep understanding of navigation and pathfinding systems, including \textbf{Recast} integration\\
